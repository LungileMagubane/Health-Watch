# Health-Watch - AI platform for African Healthcare Facilities

Welcome to the Health watch repository! Health Watch is an AI-driven platform that detect and monitor disease outbreaks in Africa before the disease spread. Health Watch uses AI and Machine learning algorithms to identify unusual patterns that may indicate emerging health threats through the analysis of data from various data sources such as social media, news report, and medical literature.

## Sructure 
This repository is structured as follows:
* Backend: This directory contains the backend code of the Health Watch platform, including database models, business logic, and the pre-processing steps of data to ensure that the data used for identifying patterns and trends is clean and of high quality. The backend code will be implemented using Node.js, PHP and laravel. Preprocessing of data will be done using python libraries such as pandas and numpy.

*  Frontend: Here we have the frontend code for our platform. This will be implemented using React,Tailwind and Bootstrap. We will also use HTML,CSS and Javascript
*  Models: We will use Llama 2 and fine-tune it to fit the context of our platform
  

## Purpose 
The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space for development and improvement of the Health Watch platform. By making the repository publicly accessible, we aim to foster community engagement, allowing developers, contributors, and users to explore the codebase, report issues, and suggest enhancements.We want other developers to help us improve on our platform and we also want to inspire other developers to improve on the code when working on their solutions.

## How Generative AI Models Power Health watch
Health Watch leverages Llama 2 model to fine-tune the model to tasks that are specific to Health Watch use cases.

* Simplified and user-friendly interface
* Integration of Health information from diverse data sources
* Predict and forecase potential desease spread and outbreak progress
* Summarise insigts gained from Medical literature and academic papers
* Customised alarts and notifications of the health outbreaks in real time.
